## RECENT_PERFORMANCE
Based on the internal report and external web search results, here's a comparison of the narrative tone between management and analysts:

**Financial Snapshot**

Management:
The company has delivered strong Q2 FY26 with broad-based growth and faster profit expansion. Revenue growth is expected to be around 10% YoY, driven by increasing demand for its products in various industries.

Analysts:
According to analyst estimates, 3M India Limited's revenue is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8-10% over the next few years. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are expected to rise by 15-20% YoY, driven by increasing sales volume and improved margins.

**Management Tone**

Management appears to be optimistic about the company's recent financial performance. The language used is positive, with phrases such as "strong Q2 FY26," "broad-based growth," and "faster profit expansion." Management also mentions that revenue growth is expected to be around 10% YoY, which suggests a positive outlook for future growth.

**Analyst Tone**

Analysts seem to be cautiously optimistic about the company's prospects. While some analysts are forecasting strong growth rates, others are more conservative in their estimates. The language used is generally neutral, with phrases such as "estimated" and "projected." Analysts also mention potential risks, such as escalating geopolitical tensions and economic pressures.

**Tone Divergence Assessment**

There appears to be a divergence in tone between management and analysts. Management is clearly optimistic about the company's recent financial performance, while analysts are more cautious in their assessments. This may indicate that management is being overly optimistic about the company's prospects, while analysts are being more realistic about potential challenges. However, it's also possible that management is simply presenting a positive outlook, which is not necessarily at odds with analyst estimates.
