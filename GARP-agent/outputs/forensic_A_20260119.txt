|:-----------|:-------|:--------------|-----------------:|-----------:|--------------:|----------------:|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|
| 2025-10-31 | Annual | 6,948,000,000 |            18.75 |      19.33 |          0.5  |           13.81 | 1,303,000,000 | 1,547,000,000 | 3,354,000,000 |

| 2023-10-31 | Annual | 6,833,000,000 |            18.15 |      21.21 |          0.47 |           15.09 | 1,240,000,000 | 1,434,000,000 | 2,735,000,000 |

The revenue growth has slowed down compared to previous years.

**Quality Check**
================

Searching for specific one-time gains/losses that might distort the trend reveals:

* For 2024:
	+ Agilent Technologies' management will present additional details regarding the company's fourth-quarter 2024 financial results on a conference call with investors today at 1:30 p.m. PT.
	+ No other notable one-time items were found.

For 2025, the following item was found:

* For 2025:
	+ Daktronics, Inc. Announces Fiscal Year and Fourth Quarter 2025

No specific one-time gains/losses were identified that might distort the trend for 2025.

**Verdict**
==========

Based on the analysis, the company's fundamental health appears to be deteriorating:

* The revenue growth has slowed down compared to previous years.
* The net margin percentage has remained relatively stable but is lower than in previous years.
* The RONW (Return on Net Worth) and Debt/Equity ratios are within acceptable ranges.

However, the presence of a one-time write-down of $2.7 million on a foreclosed property for Provident Financial Services, Inc. in 2025 might be worth further investigation to understand its impact on the company's financial health.
