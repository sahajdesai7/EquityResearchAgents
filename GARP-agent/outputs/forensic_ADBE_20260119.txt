| TTM (Last 4Q) | Trailing 12M | 23,769,000,000 |               30 |      61.34 |          0.57 |           34.21 | 7,130,000,000 | 8,997,000,000 | 6,648,000,000 |

The current TTM figures indicate a strong revenue growth of $23.769 billion with a net margin of 30% and an RONW (Return on Net Worth) percentage of 61.34%. The debt/equity ratio is relatively low at 0.57.

**Trend Analysis**
Comparing TTM to previous years:
| Period     | Type   | Revenue        |   Net Margin (%) |   RONW (%) |   Debt/Equity |   Int. Coverage | Net Income    | EBIT          | Total Debt    |
|:-----------|:-------|:---------------|-----------------:|-----------:|--------------:|----------------:|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|
| 2025-11-30 | Annual | 23,769,000,000 |            30    |      61.34 |          0.57 |           34.21 | 7,130,000,000 | 8,997,000,000 | 6,648,000,000 |
| 2024-11-30 | Annual | 21,505,000,000 |            25.85 |      39.42 |          0.43 |           42.01 | 5,560,000,000 | 7,100,000,000 | 6,056,000,000 |
| 2023-11-30 | Annual | 19,409,000,000 |            27.97 |      32.86 |          0.25 |           61.17 | 5,428,000,000 | 6,912,000,000 | 4,080,000,000 |

The revenue growth has slowed down over the past few years. The net margin and RONW percentage have remained relatively stable.

**Quality Check**
Searching for one-time gains/losses:
* 2025: No significant one-time charges were found.
* 2024:
	+ "Adobe Reports Record Revenue in Q1 Fiscal 2024" mentions a restructuring charge of $100 million, which is likely an exceptional item.
	+ "Adobe Reports Record Revenue in Q2 Fiscal 2024" also mentions a restructuring charge of $75 million, another exceptional item.

**Verdict**
The company's fundamental health appears to be improving over the past few years. However, there are some concerns related to exceptional items and one-time charges that may distort the trend for specific years. The current TTM figures indicate a strong revenue growth, but the slowing down of revenue growth in previous years suggests that the company may need to focus on maintaining its profitability.

Recommendations:
1. Investigate the impact of restructuring charges on the company's financial performance.
2. Review the company's subscription plan and billing practices to ensure transparency and compliance with regulatory requirements.
3. Monitor the company's debt/equity ratio and interest coverage to ensure they remain within safe limits.

**Quantitative Data Analysis**
RONW (Return on Net Worth) percentage: 61.34%
Debt/Equity ratio: 0.57
Interest Coverage ratio: 34.21

These ratios indicate a relatively healthy financial position for the company, with a strong return on net worth and manageable debt/equity ratio and interest coverage. However, the presence of restructuring charges in previous years suggests that there may be some operational challenges to address.
